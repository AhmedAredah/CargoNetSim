/**

 * @brief Header for the ShipSimulationClient class
 *
 * This file defines the ShipSimulationClient class, which
 * manages interactions with the ship simulation server
 * within the CargoNetSim framework. It provides interfaces
 * for defining simulators, managing ships and containers,
 * and retrieving simulation states.
 *
 * Thread safety is ensured through careful use of
 * read-write locks for shared data protection. The class
 * leverages ThreadSafetyUtils to provide RAII-style
 * locking.

 *
 * This class extends SimulationClientBase to provide
 * specialized functionality for ship simulation, including
 * simulator setup, ship and container management, and state
 * retrieval. It uses RabbitMQ for communication and ensures
 * thread-safe operations.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All operations that modify shared state (m_networkData,
 * m_shipState, etc.) are protected by appropriate read or
 * write locks
 * - Read operations use ScopedReadLock for concurrent
 * access
 * - Write operations use ScopedWriteLock for exclusive
 * access
 * - Event handlers that only log information do not use
 * locks
 * - Event handlers that modify state use appropriate
 * locking
 * - Messages from RabbitMQ are processed on the main Qt
 * event loop thread
